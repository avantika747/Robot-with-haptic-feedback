# Robot-with-Haptic-Feedback
A soft robotic sleeve made of textiles and electro-pneumatic components to provide haptic feedback during minimally invasive surgical procedures.

Features:
1. Haptic feedback is generated when the Force Resistive Sensor detects applied force/pressure. This is turn triggers the pump to inflate the textile glove, thereby providing pneumatic feedback.
2. Audio feedback using a piezoelectric buzzer (in addition to the visual feedback with LEDs) - buzzes when the applied pressure exceeds a certain range.
